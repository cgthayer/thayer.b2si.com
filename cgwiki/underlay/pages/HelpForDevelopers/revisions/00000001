MoinMoin would miss quite some features without the help of some of its users/developers. What you can do to improve MoinMoin, also for your own benefit:
 * develop new extensions like macros, actions and parsers  (MoinMoin:MoinMoinExtensions)
 * run the development version and help testing the new features or test MoinMoin on a certain platform, or with certain Python versions (MoinMoin:MoinMoinTesting)
 * help with the translation efforts, especially adding new languages (MoinMoin:MoinDev/Translation)
 * help developping new themes, styles and icons (MoinMoin:MoinDev/ThemeDevelopment)
 * etc.

If you want to help you should look on existing bugs at MoinMoin:MoinMoinBugs and look what user want at MoinMoin:FeatureRequests.

More information on MoinMoin source code and other developer issues can be found in the MoinMoin main wiki, on MoinMoin:MoinDev and its subpages.
