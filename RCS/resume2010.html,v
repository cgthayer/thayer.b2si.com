</p>

<p>
Worked on the "Web Search Content System Team" on cluster management
and monitoring software (C++), distributed data storage, and the
operation of the production web crawlers.  During this time the main
web crawl system started at 100 nodes, went through 5 cluster
doublings, and is currently 3,600 nodes.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Content Operations Team (1yr): Managed the deployment, operations,
and monitoring of production web crawler clusters in distributed data
centers.  Typical projects included moving 1.8 PB across coasts.
Catalog Agility Project: Primary architect on crawler scalability and
data storage refactoring and changes to sharding (C++) resulting in a
"You Rock Award".

<li>Crawler Team (4.5 yr): Catalog Master: Built and extended cluster
management and monitoring software for managing thousands of nodes
(C++).  Many projects ranging from investigating problems based on
statistical anomolies in freshness, comprehensiveness, and quality
(Python) to writing disk burnin software (C) used by all of YST (Yahoo
Search Technology).  Wrote CTA package (Cluster Trends Analyzer) in
Python and CluStats (Cluster Stats and alerts) libraries in C++.

<li>Echelon Team (1.5 yr): Echelon Master: worked on cluster management
software for controlling indexing pipeline and batch processing (C++).
Echelon Copier (EchCp in C &amp; C++): cross-coast database distribution
software with extensive performance throttling controls for delivering
production index data to other groups.
