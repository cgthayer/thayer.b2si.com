Worked on web search content systems for 7 years, with 4 managers, on
3 teams, during 5 cluster doublings, with thousands of nodes per
cluster.  Mainly worked on cluster management and monitoring software
(C++) and the operation of the production web crawlers.

Content Operations Team: Managed the deployment, operations, and
monitoring of production web crawler clusters in distributed data
centers.  Typical projects included moving 1.8 PB across coasts.
Catalog Agility Project: Primary architect on crawler scalability and
data storage changes (C++).

Crawler Team: Catalog Master: Built and extended cluster
management and monitoring software for managing thousands of nodes
(C++).  Many projects ranging from investigating problems based on
statistical anomolies in freshness, comprehensiveness, and quality
(Python) to writing disk burnin software (C) used by all of YST (Yahoo
Search Technology).  Wrote CTA package (Cluster Trends Analyzer) in
Python and CluStats (Cluster Stats and alerts) libraries in C++.

Echelon Team: Echelon Master: worked on cluster management
software for controlling indexing pipeline and batch processing (C++).
Echelon Copier (EchCp in C &amp; C++): cross-coast database distribution
software with extensive performance throttling controls for delivery
production index data to other groups.
