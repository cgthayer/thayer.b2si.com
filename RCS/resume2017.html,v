       Hi,

       It's nice to know that people still take the time and
       attention to check the source.  Since you're so interested
       in this document you might want to note that there are
       several sections which were commented out.  I don't think
       the HTML here is particularly special, but I'd be happy to
       answer any questions you might have.  Just drop me an email.

       Thanks,

		  Inside Data@@Scale 2015 (ZippyDB overview)

		  https://code.facebook.com/posts/371721473024046/inside-data-scale-2015/
		  
		  (See embedded video) Muthu Annamalai from Facebook spoke about
		  ZippyDB, a highly reliable key/value memory cache service used by
		  many Facebook services. Annamalai spoke about the architecture of
		  ZippyDB, the additional services built on top to make it even more
		  useful beyond a traditional key-value store. This makes it ideal to
		  serve the varied needs of Facebook's applications. He also discussed
		  ZippyDB's ability to give application services tight control over
		  data placement


		  Facebook’s Large Scale Monitoring System Built on HBase: Strata Conference + Hadoop World 2012

		  http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/stratany2012/public/schedule/speaker/146356
		  
		  ODS is Facebook’s internal monitoring system, which collects a variety of system and application level metrics from every server for real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, alerting and analysis.

		  In this talk, we’ll start by giving an overview of ODS, and go over
		  the manageability and scalability challenges with the previous MySQL
		  based setup. We will then discuss our motivation to choose HBase for
		  this workload, and share a series of lessons learnt from building
		  ODS on top of HBase, [...]

  (ZippyDB) and Monitoring systems teams.
</p>

<ul>
  <li class="li-major">
  Data Infrastructure: Worked on ZippyDB, a distributed and replicated
  key-value store based on Paxos and RocksDB.  Helped port the
  real-time counter service (unique counters based on HyperLogLog) to
  ZippyDB (with live customers) and migrated it to Folly Futures for
  our C++ APIs.  Implemented the first production version of the shard
  load balancer, which enabled balancing on several metrics across
  possibly heterogeneous hardware.

  <li class="li-major">
  Core Infrastructure: Monitoring Systems: Moved the backend operating
  metrics and monitoring systems from a MySQL backend to HBase, and
  worked on Disaster Recovery.  Worked on many of the subsystems such
  as real-time percentile aggregation, prediction modeling, and the
  real-time computation engine. System processed over 1 Billion time
  series datapoints per minute at the time I left the team.

  Inside Data@@Scale 2015 (ZippyDB overview)

  https://code.facebook.com/posts/371721473024046/inside-data-scale-2015/
  
  (See embedded video) Muthu Annamalai from Facebook spoke about
  ZippyDB, a highly reliable key/value memory cache service used by
  many Facebook services. Annamalai spoke about the architecture of
  ZippyDB, the additional services built on top to make it even more
  useful beyond a traditional key-value store. This makes it ideal to
  serve the varied needs of Facebook's applications. He also discussed
  ZippyDB's ability to give application services tight control over
  data placement


  Facebook’s Large Scale Monitoring System Built on HBase: Strata Conference + Hadoop World 2012

  http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/stratany2012/public/schedule/speaker/146356
  
  ODS is Facebook’s internal monitoring system, which collects a variety of system and application level metrics from every server for real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, alerting and analysis.

  In this talk, we’ll start by giving an overview of ODS, and go over
  the manageability and scalability challenges with the previous MySQL
  based setup. We will then discuss our motivation to choose HBase for
  this workload, and share a series of lessons learnt from building
  ODS on top of HBase, [...]
