<B>Senior Engineer</B><br>
<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/"><EM>
Yahoo Inc.</EM></a>, 701 First Ave., Sunnyvale, CA<br>
</p>

<p>
Worked on the "Web Search Content System Team" on cluster management
and monitoring software (C++), distributed data storage, and the
operation of the production web crawlers.  During this time the main
web crawl system started at 100 nodes, went through 5 cluster
doublings, and is currently 3,600 nodes.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Content Operations Team (1yr): Managed the deployment, operations,
and monitoring of production web crawler clusters in distributed data
centers.  Typical projects included moving 1.8 PB across coasts.
Catalog Agility Project: Primary architect on crawler scalability and
data storage refactoring and changes to sharding (C++) resulting in a
"You Rock Award".

<li>Crawler Team (4.5 yr): Catalog Master: Built and extended cluster
management and monitoring software for managing thousands of nodes
(C++).  Many projects ranging from investigating problems based on
statistical anomolies in freshness, comprehensiveness, and quality
(Python) to writing disk burnin software (C) used by all of YST (Yahoo
Search Technology).  Wrote CTA package (Cluster Trends Analyzer) in
Python and CluStats (Cluster Stats and alerts) libraries in C++.

<li>Echelon Team (1.5 yr): Echelon Master: worked on cluster management
software for controlling indexing pipeline and batch processing (C++).
Echelon Copier (EchCp in C &amp; C++): cross-coast database distribution
software with extensive performance throttling controls for delivering
production index data to other groups.

<P>
Tapstone's Server Change Center is an IT tool for managing enterprises
with hundreds to thousands of machines.  Agent software running on
each computer detects changes to the file system, the registry, and
configuration files (on both Solaris and Windows.)  These agents each
communicate a stream of events in real-time to a central appliance
(running Linux and Postgres.)  
</P>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Designed the distributed network agent for portability,
scalability, and low-impact.

<li>Wrote low-level back-end software for Solaris, Linux, and Windows
NT in Python and C++.  Implemented hardware scanner, control
daemon, and various libraries.

<li>Reviewed code, unit tests, system tests, and design work as the
manager and lead engineer of the agent group (4-6 developers,
including myself.)

<li>Designed APIs, libraries, and protocols as lead engineer of the
architecture team during system design phases.  Reviewed system-wide
design and implementation choices to support the goals of high
performance, fail-safe operation.

<li>One of the authors of the provisional patent application: <a
